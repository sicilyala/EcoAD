An eco-driving framework considering both longitudinal and lateral maneuvers 
based on deep reinforcement learning algorithms. 
The simulation environment is based on the highway-env. The DRL algorithms employ the Stable-baselines3.
The research object is a fuel-cell hybrid electric vehicle. And the energy management of the FCHEV is simultaneously optimized.
